# LactoseFreeDiabetic
New website design

Attenpting to upgrade my skills (they are 20 years old, lol)

Code Kentucky/Louieville  Web Developement Course. I actually own the domain and want to get the site completed before I buy hosting space. It's been in my head for a while as I am lactose Intolerant and have diabeties. It makes life challanging. Especially since I have to avoid soy as well.
